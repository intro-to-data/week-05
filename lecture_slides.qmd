# Goals

- Use what we have learned to perform a real Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
- Dig into the structure we are using every week.
- Discuss limitations and biases in the data we have.



## Why Exploratory Data Analysis?

1. Better understand our data.
2. Figure out what our next questions are.

And our topic is . . . . 



# Police Shootings

::: {.notes}
We are still going to have some fun/silly data sets. But we also need some serious data sets.
:::



## _Some_ Context: {.smaller}

- August 9, 2014: Michael Brown is killed in Ferguson Missouri sparking outrage throughout the nation.
- A 2014 Washington Post investigation of the FBI's data reports they could find less than 50% of known police shootings.
- February 12, 2015: The FBI Director calls for better data collection of use-of-force data.
- The Washington Post starts an independent "Police Shootings Database" in 2015.
- January 1, 2019: Enhanced data collection of use-of-force data is launched nationwide.
  - ***All law enforcement agencies are encouraged to participate.***
- According to the Washington Post, only ***1 out of 3*** fatal police shootings appeared in the FBI database by 2021.
  - They must be using Freedom on Information Act (FOIA) to calculate their numbers.



## Links (in Canvas):

- Washington Post:
  - [As fatal police shootings increase, more go unreported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/interactive/2022/fatal-police-shootings-unreported/_)
  - [Police Shootings Database](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/)
- FBI:
  - [National Use-of-Force Data Collection](https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/more-fbi-services-and-information/ucr/use-of-force)
  - [Crime Data Explorer](https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/home)
    - Is this a (not-funny) joke?

::: {.notes}
These links are in Canvas and I encourage you to look at each of them.

I want to pause and look over the FBI links right now.

## Why?

1. Data is a ⚒️ to understand our 🌎.
    - This topic is _(I hope)_ more engaging than talking about home sales in Texas or 🐧🐧🐧.
3. Highlight/discuss:
    - What we _can_ learn from the data we have.
    - What we _cannot_ learn from the data we have.

::: {.notes}
I think it is worth briefly exploring the setup of this week's project.

::: {.notes}
Why the white background on this slide you ask? Well, my graphic looks terrible on anything else.

I think of each of these three regions as a hat.

Sometimes I have to put on my developer hat. Sometimes I have to put on my stats hat. Sometimes I have to put on my social worker hat.

## Hacking Skills

- Demo:
  - Import the data.
  - Create a local data set.
- Participation Required:
  - EDA
  - Plotting/Graphing (ggplot)
  - Data Management/Transformation (Munge!!!)



## Substantive Expertise {.smaller}

- **Assumption:** Citizens in a free country should not be shot by law enforcement on a regular basis.
- Lived Experience.
- Many underlying causes:
  - [Five Thirty Eight: Why Are So Many Black Americans Killed By Police?](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-are-so-many-black-americans-killed-by-police/)

::: {.notes}
It is important, in research, to state your assumptions. My assumption in this is that citizens . . . . 

We do _not_ bring the same lived experience to the conversation. Not even close.

Yet we do each have a lived experience and that experience will shape our perspective and understanding of this discussion.

We need to acknowledge that right out of the gate.

## Statistics

- Averages
- Percents ％ ← <span style="color: green">_NEW!_</span>
- Bar plots 📊
- Time Series 📈
- Heat Maps ← <span style="color: green">_NEW!_</span>
- Choropleth 🗺️ ← <span style="color: green">_NEW!_</span>

::: {.notes}
- Most of what we are going to do is go _deeper_ into skills we already know.
- But there will be a couple of new things.
- Time Series isn't _really_ new, but the term may be new to some of you.

# Next Steps

- Import data from 🌐
- EDA
- Going further



## Import Data From 🌐 {.smaller}

Tasks:

- Look at CSV
- Look at JSON
- Import/Save
- Discuss Grain . . . . 🤗
  - Each row is a a person/event.
  - I would argue that event is a better description of this data than person.
    - I'll explain why later.

**GO TO CODE**

::: {.notes}
Discuss grain . . . . you know we have to have this talk . . . .

## EDA {.smaller .scrollable}

- Does the total number of police shootings increase every year?
- Which demographic groups are most impacted? From our data:
  - Nulls (Bar Plot, Time Series)
  - Threat Type (Bar Plot, Time Series)
  - Flee Status (Bar Plot, Time Series)
  - Armed With (Bar Plot, Time Series)
  - Location Precision (Bar Plot, Time Series)
    - ?City?
    - ?County?
    - ?State?
  - Age (Bar Plot, Time Series)
  - Gender (Bar Plot, Time Series)
  - Race/Race Source (Bar Plot, Time Series)
  - Was Mental Illness Related (Bar Plot, Time Series)
  - Body Camera (Bar Plot, Time Series)
- Does the percentage of Black Americans shot by police change over time?

**GO TO CODE**



## Going Further {.smaller .scrollable}

- What biases may exist in this data?
- Based on this data, what can we not know?
- Events:
  - We know how many _people_ died.
  - We know each of these was during a police encounter.
  - We do NOT know how many police encounters took place.
- In other words:
  - Is risk a function of certain groups having more encounters with the police?
  - Is risk a function of each event being more dangerous for certain groups?
  - Note: Both could be true.
  - Because we don't have records of police encounters that _don't_ result in a fatality, we cannot explore this.
    - 🤯 That we do not know this is, to me, mind boggling. 🤯
- Population Demographics:
  - We are not controlling for population demographics either.
  - A fact which makes this data even more appalling.
- What else would you want to ask of this data, even if it means you need more data?
- How do you think this data should be reported?
  - Should agencies get a participation award for reporting data or should it be mandatory?
- Should there be federal measures?
