# How many data privacy laws can you name?

## Data, Privacy, and "Free" Services

- Have you ever stopped to think about _how_: 
    - Google affords to give you a free GMail account?
    - Twitter makes money while offering ass-hats the world over a free soap box?
    - Facebook is really using your data?
- None of these services are truly free.

# Where would YOU place the boundary between data and privacy?

## The Big Picture

- The US has no single nationwide privacy law.
- Instead, we have a patchwork of state and national laws.
- In most states, including NYS, there is no law regulating how private companies may use your data.
- Of course, if a company violates their own terms and conditions, you can sue them.
    - This is a civil, not legal remedy.
    - And if they told you they were going to sell your data . . . . 
    - And they can afford more lawyers than you can!

## US Privacy Laws

- Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
- Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)
- Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)
- Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA)
- Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA)
- Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA)
- Video Privacy Protection Act (VPPA)
- Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act)

## HIPAA (1)

- Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
    - One P, Two A's!!!
- Privacy Rule establishes national standards to protect individuals' medical records and other individually identifiable health information (collectively defined as “protected health information”) and applies to health plans, health care clearinghouses, and those health care providers that conduct certain health care transactions electronically.
    - It is legal for covered entities to share your health care data with third parties for business purposes. 
    - They cannot sell your data.
- Only applies to covered entities.
    - Your doctor and any contractors hired by them who work with data ARE covered entities.
- Two relevant examples

## HIPAA (2)

- Portability of health care data is an important and often overlooked facet of HIPAA.
- You can instruct a covered entity to share your records with a third party.
    - Urgent Care Example
- HIPAA empowers you to have access to your own records.


## FERPA

- Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)
- Relevant to all of you, since you are all students.
- Focus: Makes student records private and empowers students/parents.
- Only applies to schools which receive Department of Education Funding.
- Like HIPAA, gives you the right to see your records.
    - However, they need not be portable.
- You can request the school change records you believe are inaccurate.
    - There is the right to a formal hearing.
- There are exceptions.

## Others (1/2)

- **Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA):** Limits who is allowed to see a credit report, what the credit bureaus can collect, and how information is obtained.
- **Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA):** Requires consumer financial products, such as loan services or investment-advice services, to explain how they share data, as well as the customer's right to opt out.
    - No restrictions on how companies use the data they collect, as long as they disclose such usage beforehand.
    - Attempts to put guardrails on the security of some personal data.
- **Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA):** Limits government wiretaps on telephone calls and other electronic signals (though the USA Patriot Act redefined much of this).
    -Sets broad rules concerning how employers can monitor employee communications.
    - Passed in 1986 & is outdated.
    - Does not protect against modern surveillance tactics such as law enforcement access of older data stored on servers, in cloud storage documents, and in search queries.

## Others (2/2)

- **Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA):** Limits data collection for children under 13 years old.
- **Video Privacy Protection Act (VPPA):** Prevents the disclosure of VHS rental records, but has never been held against streaming companies.
    - A journalist accessed supreme court nominee's Robert Bork's VHS history.
- **Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act):** Enables the FTC to prosecute an app/website which violates its own privacy policy.
    - This can include marketing language related to privacy.
    - Example: When Zoom deceived users by claiming video chats were end-to-end encrypted.

## State Privacy Laws

- California (CCPA and its amendment, CPRA)
- Virginia (VCDPA)
- Colorado (ColoPA)
- These laws apply only to people who live in these states.
- Because they are all different, they make it very challenging for companies operating in multiple states.
- They are broadly similar.
    - Require companies to tell you if they will sell your data.
    - Give you some option (usually weak) to opt in/out (mostly out).
    - Rights to access, delete, move, correct your data.
- New York State Privacy Act (2021, 2022)

## EU Privacy Laws

- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- Requires companies to ask for some permissions to share data and gives individuals rights to access, delete, or control the use of that data.

## Other Considerations

- The EU and China require companies operating in their country to maintain "local" offices and data centers.
    - The EU requires this because EU laws require MORE privacy than other regions.
    - China requires this to give the CCP more control of their citizens' data.

## Questions

- Should the US have a single comprehensive data privacy law?
- What should it look like/cover?
- What should the boundaries of data sharing be?
- What is the moral/ethical framework to base such laws on?

## Consequences

- The consequences of data can be huge.
- Watch the next video. Let me know what you think.
